# Welcome to my Remix template!

For more information head over to: [Remix](https://remix.run/docs)

## What's inside?

This template consists of:

- TailwindCSS
- Headless UI
- Daisy UI
- Prisma

Prisma comes with a schema and a seed file.
Also check the folder /app/data which includes some logic for Prisma.


### Don't forget!

1. Make sure the .env file exists. In this template I use SQLite (see .env.example)
2. Make the db:

``` sh
npx prisma db push
```
3. Seed the database 
``` sh
npx prisma db seed
```
4. Try it out!

``` sh
npm run dev
```
